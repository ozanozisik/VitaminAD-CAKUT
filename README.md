# Overlap of vitamin A and vitamin D target genes with CAKUT-related processes

Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT) are a group of abnormalities affecting the kidneys and their outflow tracts. Vitamins are among the environmental factors that are considered for CAKUT aetiology. In this study, we collected vitamin A and vitamin D target genes and computed their overlap with CAKUT-related gene sets. The results were published in [F1000 Research](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.51018.2). The code and the data shared here, along with resulting and supplementary files, are available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4501623).
